✔ Make sure that trajectory's omega is correctly computed @done(20-11-24 08:30)

# RNN
✔ Make sure that data preprocessing normalized train and test datasets separately @done(20-11-20 13:53)
✔ Try training RNN with truncated input data and see if it can be used to augment dataset @done(20-11-24 15:11)
☐ Add methods to inspect the pre processed dataset to make sure everything's fine
☐ Inspect the data"
☐ think about how to train this goddam RNNs
